This is a *work in progress*. Webpage Architecture's proposed alternative to markup is Mark, which relies on its control characters. This project has no reference to HTML's `<mark>` tag.

An example of Mark:
```
You are using a file {b}marked{/b} with Mark.
{mark https://github.com/philandy/webpageArchitecture/}
```
